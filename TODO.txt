Add:
    @ADD: possibility to FelixButton for adding an icon to the left of the text, like in FelixInputField

Create:
    @CREATE: Password Field Class (like FelixInputField just with hidden text and secure handling as well as display real text button)
    @CREATE: Checkbox Field Class
    @CREATE: Slider Field Class
    @CREATE: Good FileChooser Class
    @CREATE: Scroll Pane Class

Fix:
    @FIX FelixTextPane animation
    @FIX FelixFrame close and minimize Button get blurry because of resizing
    @FIX All drawings should have fixed bounds (not changing for animation) and just the rounded rectangle gets different size, so it doesnt effect the sounrroundings
